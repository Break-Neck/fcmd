The File Commander (fcmd)
====

A customizable and extendable cross-platform two-panel file manager - The File Commander.

##How to compile:

1. Get the sources by cloning the Git repo: $ git clone https://github.com/atauenis/fcmd.git
2. Using the Visual Studio 2010 (or newer) or MonoDevelop 3.0 (or newer) compile the solution file.
3. Go to the bin/Release (or bin/Debug) subdirectory and run "fcmd.exe".

System requirements: Microsoft .NET Framework v4.x or fresh Mono Runtime version (they are backward-compatible:)).
Also you need a C# compiler, which supports VS 2010 solutions.
